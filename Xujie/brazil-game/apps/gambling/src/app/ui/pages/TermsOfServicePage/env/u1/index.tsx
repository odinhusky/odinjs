      Protecting yourself:
      <TermsBr/>
      If you watch the news often, you've probably heard about identity theft. Unfortunately, identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes both online and offline, and can lead to serious financial problems if not immediately discovered or prevented altogether.
      <TermsBr/>
      {environment.platformName} takes all possible precautions to protect your sensitive personal information. But regardless of how hard we work to ensure that your information always remains safe, the best defense we can offer is to remind you that any personal information given to other Users can eventually end up on the hands of criminals. With that in mind, we developed the following list of things you can do to protect your privacy:
      <TermsBr/>
      - Never give out your login name or password. No {environment.platformName} employee will ever ask for this information and if someone does, it should be reported immediately to the Janitors on any {environment.platformName} websites, who can help you with any problems you may have without ever needing to provide your login information. All you need to know to access the software and participate in games can be found on the website after logging in. Always be suspicious of anyone offering help and asks for your personal information such as passwords, bank details, account numbers and payment methods. REMEMBER TO NEVER PROVIDE THEM!
      <TermsBr/>
      - Be careful with external links! Sometimes, users can send you links to sites that allege to be part of {environment.platformName} and may ask you for personal information. Every time you visit a site, check the address bar, if the site is not under the domain name of any {environment.platformName} websites, then is NOT our site. Warning, if you see a fake {environment.platformName} website, inform us immediately so we can take appropriate measures.
      <TermsBr/>
      After asking to be excluded from playing on any of our sites, your decision is irreversible.
      <TermsBr/>
