              At the Users request, we shall erase or anonymize their personal

              If we are required to retain personal data in order to comply with

              all the necessary personal data for the period required by
              applicable law;

            <div>

              or share the personal data obtained from Users with third parties
              located in countries other than their country of residence. The
              personal data obtained from Users may, therefore, be subject to
              privacy laws different from those in force in their country of
              residence.
            </div>
            <div>
              Personal data collected in the European Union and Switzerland may,
              for instance, be transferred and processed by third parties located
              in a country outside the European Union and Switzerland. In these
              cases, {environment.platformName} shall ensure that the transfer of
              Users personal data is carried out in accordance with the applicable
              privacy laws, as well as ensure, in particular, the adoption of the

              we be held responsible for, the privacy practices and content by
              third parties. If a User clicks on an advertisement or a third-party
              URL, they should be aware that they are exiting the Slots Big Boss
              service and that any personal data they provide shall not be covered
              by this Policy. Users should read the respective privacy policies in

            <div>11. Keeping Users personal data safe:</div>
            <div>
              We are committed to protecting the personal data of our Users.
            </div>
            <div>
              We implement technical and organizational measures to help protect
              the security of the personal data obtained from our Users, namely:
              creation of nicknames, encryption and access and retention policies
              to prevent unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal
              data in our systems. However, Users must be made aware of the fact
              that no system is completely secure.
            </div>
            <div>
              A password protects User accounts, and that is why we encourage
              Users to use a unique and robust password, to limit access to
              computers, browsers and other devices deemed secure (trusted), and
              to log out after using the {environment.platformName} service.
